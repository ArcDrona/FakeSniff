## Features

- **Multi-Model Detection**: Utilizes multiple DeepFake detection models to analyze media content:
  - `example_model_image.py`: Basic image deepfake detection model
  - `n_video.py` and `a_video.py`: Video deepfake detection models
  - Support for Hugging Face models integration
- **File Upload**: Supports uploading images (jpg, png, jpeg), videos (mp4, mov), and audio files (mp3, wav).
- **URL Input**: Allows users to input URLs for image, video, or audio analysis.
- **Processing Unit Selection**: Option to use GPU for supported models (default is CPU).
- **Result Visualization**:
  - Displays DeepFake detection statistics in a table format.
  - Provides downloadable CSV of detection results.
  - Visualizes results with bar charts for DeepFake probability and inference time.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akshay-jain-22/Speech-Detection.git
   cd Speech-Detection
   ```

2. **Create a conda environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create -n fakesniff python=3.8 -y
   conda activate fakesniff
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Model Setup**:

   The application includes several pre-configured models:
   - `example_model_image.py`: For image deepfake detection
   - `n_video.py` and `a_video.py`: For video deepfake detection
   - Hugging Face model integration support

   You can also add your own custom models by following the instructions in `Add_Custom_Model_to_DeepSafe.md`.

5. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Select the "Detector" option** from the sidebar.
2. **Upload an image, video, or audio file**, or provide a URL.
3. **Choose one or multiple DeepFake detection models** you want to use.
4. **Optionally select GPU processing** if available.
5. **Click "Real or Fake? ðŸ¤”"** to start the analysis.
6. **View the results** in the displayed charts and tables, comparing outputs from different models.

## Future Work

FakeSniff aims to incorporate newer models and expand its capabilities to enhance DeepFake detection accuracy and efficiency.
